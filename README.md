## Inspiration

The main inspiration behind this program was that we need as many people to aid in protecting the earth as possible, but something inhibiting that is people just not knowing what exactly they want to do or how to do it. That's how I came up with the idea for a form to receive direct user input to create goals for them, so that it's tailored to **them** and helps them get started. 

## What it does

The user starts off my filling out the form on the right side of the screen to their exact preferences. Once the user finishes and clicks generate, the goal will appear on the left side of the screen on the dashboard. The goal will be color coded according to the size of it (Red - Large, Yellow - Medium, Green - Small) and will be counted in the counter of the respective color at the top of the dash. Once the user is finished with their goals, they can clear all of them with the **"Clear"** button and have a fresh dashboard ready for use. 

## How I built it

The majority of this program was JavaScript, which I used to create the functions which allow for all the features to work. From there, it was a mix of CSS and HTML equally, where I created the bare elements for the page and styled them according to the color pallet. I created the logo myself with the help of some pixel art designs! 

## Challenges I ran into

It was a bit difficult finding out how to get the goals to show up on the dashboard after being generated. It took a lot of meticulous trial and error mixing all the features I had at my disposal to make things work, which took up a lot of my time. 

## Accomplishments that I am proud of

Something I was super happy to accomplish was that I was able to position all the elements in their proper places without many issues with the margins and paddings of other elements colliding with each other. It made the whole coding process much more easy because if I ever needed to go back and move something, I could do so without disrupting other elements. 

## What I learned

I learned a lot on implementing JavaScript into my HTML websites and how I can use JavaScript to make them much more interactive and fun. I feel like the whole experience of coding this project showed just how useful JavaScript can be for web development. 

## What's next for Green Future

In the future, I wish to add more preferences in the form section of my web page so that users may receive even more customized goals that are more to their preference and some features that even encourage the user to complete the goals they have set for themselves so that in the case they become unmotivated, we can being some inspiration and energy back to them.
